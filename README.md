# EmbeddedSystems_Course
Embedded System Course - UTFPR Curitiba - 2022

In this course main contents related to embedded systems were studied. 

For code execution, the synergy platform was used, together with the Renesas SK-S7G2 stater kit.

To execute the project, import the "luanKlein_TrabalhoFinal.zip" (this is a Synergy project) inside the Sinergy Plataform (could be used in eclipse).
